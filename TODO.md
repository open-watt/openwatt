## 2026-08-26: profiles should express derived values instead of inventing attribute ids

An IAS Zone device reports its whole state as bits of one attribute, `0x0002` (ZoneStatus,
a `map16`). The profile has no way to say "this element is bit 3 of that attribute", so it
invents an address per bit instead:

```
zb: 0x500, 0xFC01, bool    desc: alarm2
zb: 0x500, 0xFC03, bool    desc: low_battery
```

Nothing on the device answers to `0xFC01`. Priming duly asked for those ids and the reads
came back unsupported, so a contact sensor's state could not be fetched at all; the
controller carries `apply_zone_status` to decode the real attribute by hand, priming carries
a special case for cluster `0x0500`, and both are guarded by treating `>= 0xFC00` as a
never-readable range by convention.

The shared value-spec grammar already covers this, and the mapping wants to become:

```
zb: 0x500, 0x0002, bool@0    desc: alarm1
zb: 0x500, 0x0002, bool@3    desc: low_battery
```

reading the attribute the value really lives in, with the generic decode extracting the bit.
Doing it deletes `apply_zone_status` (three callers), the priming special case and the
`0xFC00` guard, and generalises well beyond zigbee: Modbus status/alarm registers, CAN
signals (which are only ever bit offset plus width), ZCL `map8`/`map16` attributes, Tuya
bitmap datapoints and SunSpec bitfields all pack many values into one wire value.

### Blocker: the element index holds one element per attribute

`_sample_elements` is keyed by `(eui, endpoint, cluster, attribute, manufacturer)` and
asserts one element per key:

```d
assert(key !in _sample_elements, "TODO: support element duplicates?");
```

so seven elements cannot share attribute `0x0002`. **The synthetic ids exist only to
manufacture unique keys** - that is the whole reason for them. The index has to hold a list
per key, and every write path becomes "update all matching" rather than "update the one":
`find_sample_element` and `find_sample_element_tuya` and each of their call sites in the
report, tuya-datapoint, read-response and priming paths.

### Gotchas

- **The notification is a command, not an attribute report.** Zone Status Change
  Notification is cluster-specific command `0x00`, carrying ZoneStatus, ExtendedStatus,
  ZoneID and Delay. The generic attribute path never sees it, so the command handler must
  keep parsing the payload and writing `0x0002`'s value; only the decode downstream becomes
  generic. `apply_zone_status` today is a pure mapper of already-decoded values, called from
  the live notification, the priming read and the replay path.
- **Bit offsets are relative to the context word, and zigbee's context is not worded.**
  `container = sliced ? (ctx.worded ? ctx.word_bytes : 0) : 0`. Modbus is
  `LayoutContext(2, true, ...)`, so `bool@3` yields `container_bytes == 2`. Zigbee compiles
  against `stream_le_context` / `stream_be_context`, which are `word_bytes = 1` and not
  worded, so container is 0. IAS needs bit 9 (`battery_defect`, mask `0x200`) of a `map16`,
  i.e. a bit offset that crosses a byte. **Verify cross-byte bit offsets decode correctly in
  a byte-stream context before trusting this** - see next point.
- **No profile uses `@bit` at all.** It is implemented and unit-tested, but the unittest
  only exercises `modbus_context` (worded, 2-byte). It has never run end-to-end, and never
  in a non-worded context. First real user should expect to shake something out.
- **`0x0002` is only readable after IAS enrolment.** Proven on hardware: before enrolment
  the read was delivered and silently ignored; ~150ms after the CIE address write landed,
  the same read was answered in 123ms. So anything that reads ZoneStatus depends on
  enrolment having run first. The device never sent an `ias_zone_enroll_request`, so it
  enrols silently and the enroll request cannot be used as proof enrolment took.
- **`zone_id` and `delay` do not fit the model.** `zone_id` has a real attribute (`0x0011`)
  it could map to. `delay` exists only in the command payload with no attribute behind it at
  all, so it stays synthetic or goes.
- **`conf/profiles` is a submodule.** A profile change ships separately from the binary and
  has to be deployed to a target in its own right, so a binary that expects the new mapping
  can meet an old profile and vice versa.
