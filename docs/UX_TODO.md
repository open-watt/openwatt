# UX client task accumulator

Client-visible changes land here as dated task sections; UX clients (sync consumers) work
through them and remove sections as they are absorbed.

## 2026-08-07: UDP moved from stream to packet interface

- `/stream/udp` collection is removed. UDP is not a byte stream; it is now modelled as a
  raw-packet interface.
- New collection `/interface/udp` (type `udp`): properties `local-host`, `local-port`,
  `remote-host`, `remote-port`, plus the standard interface MTU/status/traffic properties.
  Clients enumerating interface types should expect the new type; anything offering
  `/stream/udp` in pickers/forms must drop it.
- Log sinks can no longer be given a UDP transport (syslog over UDP is unavailable) until
  sinks can bind a packet interface.
